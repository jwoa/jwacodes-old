Music + Motion is a web application that allows users to see how people move and react to music. I am curious about how we all move differently to the same things, what makes me tap my feet may make you move your hands instead. I want to show that we’re more similar than different through music.\
\
From its initial conception to the stage it’s at now the project has changed a lot. What began as a way to just be expressive through music has now turned into an application that will analyze the users' faces for reactions to the music their listening to. When the user does something that can be defined as showing emotion, an outline of the face will show up. This can be used for many purposes including studying how people react to certain content. Also, when you consider various data points such as where the users are from, their gender, age, etc it is possible to see patterns or similarities between users based on the songs as well.

**Initial Idea**

When this project first began I really wanted it to be focused on gestures and how the user can use them to interact with their computer. I decided to use music as the base for this project because I was also interested in human behavior when it comes to music. This interest came from just observation of people on public transport and how much they move to their music and what part of their body they move.
